## 2‚Åª‚Å∏‚Å∏ threshold 

The 2‚Åª‚Å∏‚Å∏ threshold (2‚Åª‚Å∏‚Å∏ was chosen as the safety threshold in AES-XTS (IEEE P1619 / NIST SP 800-38E)) was the design target probability that the XTS designers used to define a safe maximum data-unit size (2¬≤‚Å∞ blocks = 16 MiB).

It ensures each sector‚Äôs internal structure contributes no more than a 2‚Åª‚Å∏‚Å∏ degradation to AES-128‚Äôs overall 128-bit security.

## üîπ Why 2‚Åª‚Å∏‚Å∏ instead of, say, 2‚Åª‚Å∂‚Å¥ or 2‚Åª‚Åπ‚Å∂?
2‚Åª‚Å∂‚Å¥

Too loose ‚Äî a 64-bit collision bound is comparable to a CRC32-style accidental-collision space, and no longer ‚Äúcryptographically negligible‚Äù if you encrypt trillions of sectors.

2‚Åª‚Åπ‚Å∂ or smaller

Overly strict ‚Äî would force smaller data-unit sizes (‚â§ 2¬π‚Å∂ blocks ‚âà 1 MiB), which complicates implementations with negligible real gain.

2‚Åª‚Å∏‚Å∏

Sweet spot:

- Still vastly beyond any feasible attack (‚âà 3√ó10‚Åª¬≤‚Å∑ chance).
- Matches round binary exponents (difference of 40 bits from 128).
- Allows 16 MiB maximum sector and simple hardware design.
- It‚Äôs therefore a design-level engineering constant, not a law of nature.

### Deciding ‚Äúhow small is small enough‚Äù

When the P1619 working group and NIST‚Äôs SP 800-38E editors formalized XTS, they needed a bound small enough that even in worst-case use, the total risk would remain cryptographically negligible.

They targeted:

residual¬†probability ‚â§ $\ 2^{-88} \$

It‚Äôs 40 bits below AES-128‚Äôs baseline 128-bit strength, which is:

- so small it‚Äôs astronomically unlikely in practice, yet
- not so extreme that it prevents practical 20-bit counters and 16 MiB sectors.

Formally, it means:

> even if you encrypt the largest allowed sector (16 MiB, = 2¬≤‚Å∞ blocks),
> the distinguishing advantage contributed by intra-sector collisions is ‚â§ 2‚Åª‚Å∏‚Å∏.

That bound keeps XTS‚Äôs total security level effectively at ‚âà 128 bits ‚Äì 0 bits for realistic use.

## 16 MiB maximum sector

### Numeric reasoning behind the 40-bit margin

They wanted a nice round power-of-2 number of blocks per sector that would:

> make hardware counters simple (20 bits);
> keep $\ \frac{n^2}{2^128} \$ ‚â§ 2‚Åª‚Å∏‚Å∏.

Solve:

$\ \frac{n^2}{2^128} \$ = 2‚Åª‚Å∏‚Å∏ => n = $\ 2^{20} \$

That gives $\ 2^{20} \$ blocks √ó 16 bytes = 16 MiB.
So 16 MiB naturally falls out of that $\ 2^{-88} \$ target.
In other words, the bound 2‚Åª‚Å∏‚Å∏ caused the 16 MiB cap, not the other way around.

## Structure of the XTS security proof

$\ Advantage <= \frac{q^2}{2^k} + \frac{n^2}{2^b} \$

| Symbol | Meaning                                        |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| (k)    | AES key size (128 bits)                        |
| (b)    | AES block size (128 bits)                      |
| (q)    | total number of AES invocations under one key  |
| (n)    | number of blocks within one data unit (sector) |


The second term, $\ \frac{n^2}{2^128} \$ , measures the probability that two blocks within the same data unit collide in whitening value or otherwise reveal a structural relation.
